Developers can customize the background for scenes, which will be rendered before the scene rendering. Currently, Galacean mainly supports the following types of backgrounds:

- [Solid Color Background](/en/docs/graphics-background-solidColor)
- [Texture Background](/en/docs/graphics-background-texture)
- [Sky Background](/en/docs/graphics-background-sky)

Developers can set different backgrounds according to their needs:

<playground src="background.ts"></playground>

In [Skybox](/en/docs/graphics-background-sky}) mode, by setting specific meshes and materials, various custom backgrounds can be achieved, such as `video background`:

<playground src="video-background.ts"></playground>
