A camera is an abstract concept in a graphics engine for [3D projection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3D_projection), similar to a camera or eye in the real world. Galacean's camera implements automatic frustum culling, rendering only objects within the view frustum.

## Types of Cameras

### Perspective Projection

Perspective projection follows our model of objects appearing larger when closer and smaller when farther away. Take a look at the diagram of the perspective model:

As shown in the diagram, the near clipping plane ([nearClipPlane](/apis/core/#Camera-nearClipPlane)), far clipping plane ([farClipPlane](/apis/core/#Camera-farClipPlane)), and field of view ([fieldOfView](/apis/core/#Camera-fieldOfView)) form a view frustum ([_View Frustum_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viewing_frustum)). Objects inside the view frustum are projected onto the camera and rendered on the canvas, while objects outside the view frustum are clipped.

### Orthographic Projection

Orthographic projection shows objects at the same size regardless of their distance from the viewer. The visible area generated by the orthographic projection model is called an orthographic box, depicted as follows:

As shown in the diagram, there are top, bottom, left, and right values. Galacean simplifies the orthographic properties to align more with developers' habits, using only [orthographicSize](/apis/core/#Camera-orthographicSize). The relationships between the properties and [orthographicSize](/apis/core/#Camera-orthographicSize) are as follows:

- `top = orthographicSize`
- `bottom = -orthographicSize`
- `right = orthographicSize * aspectRatio`
- `left = -orthographicSize * aspectRatio`

### Choosing Between Projections

By comparing perspective and orthographic projections, we can identify their differences:

- Visual area model
- Presence of the near/far effect

The following example demonstrates the visual differences between orthographic and perspective cameras. In summary, choose an orthographic camera for 2D effects and a perspective camera for 3D effects.

## Camera Orientation

In Galacean, local coordinates and world coordinates follow the `right-hand coordinate system`, so the camera's `forward` direction is along the `-Z` axis, and the direction of the camera's view is also in the `-Z` direction.

## Getting Started

Now that we've covered the basic concepts of cameras, let's get started:

- Add a [camera component](/en/docs/graphics-camera-component) to the scene
- Use [camera controls](/en/docs/graphics-camera-control) to easily manipulate the [camera component](/en/docs/graphics-camera-component)
- Utilize [multiple cameras](/docs/graphics/camera/multiCamera/) in the scene
- Access [camera depth textures](/docs/graphics/camera/texture/)
