The camera can enable depth texture through the [depthTextureMode](/apis/core/#Camera-depthTextureMode) property. After enabling the depth texture, you can access the depth texture in the Shader through the `camera_DepthTexture` property. Depth texture can be used to implement soft particles, water surface edge transitions, and some simple post-processing effects.

Note: Depth texture only renders non-transparent objects.
