Spine animation is a 2D skeletal animation tool designed for game development. It binds images to bones and then controls the bones to create animations. It meets the program's need for control and flexibility over animations, while also providing a more efficient and streamlined workflow for artists and designers.
Compared to traditional frame-by-frame animation, Spine animation has the following advantages:

- **Smaller size:** Traditional animations require providing an image for each frame. Spine animation only saves the animation data of the bones, which takes up very little space.
- **Art requirements:** Spine animation requires fewer art resources, saving you more manpower and resources to better invest in game development.
- **Smoothness:** Spine animation uses interpolation algorithms to calculate intermediate frames, ensuring that your animations always remain smooth.
- **Equip attachments:** Images are bound to bones to create animations. If needed, you can easily change the character's equipment to meet different requirements. You can even change the character's appearance to achieve animation reuse.
- **Blending:** Animations can be blended. For example, a character can shoot while walking, running, jumping, or swimming.
- **Programmatic animation:** Bones can be controlled through code, allowing for effects such as shooting following the mouse, looking at enemies, or leaning forward when going uphill.
