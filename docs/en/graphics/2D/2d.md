Galacean is a 3D/2D interactive solution. You can quickly experience 2D interactive development by navigating to **Menu View** on the **Editor Homepage** and selecting **Templates** -> **Pixel Bird**.

You can also create a blank 2D project by going to **Project View** on the **Editor Homepage** and selecting **New Project** -> **2D Project**.

In the editor, there isn't much difference between 2D and 3D projects, except for the change in perspective from 3D to 2D and the default camera being set to **Orthographic**. You can quickly create a 2D child node by selecting a node in the **Hierarchy Panel** and right-clicking -> **2D Object**.

In a 2D project, you can attach a **Sprite Renderer** and set a **Sprite Asset** to render images, use a **Text Renderer** to render 2D text, implement masking effects for 2D elements with **SpriteMask**, and showcase 2D effects using Lottie or Spine (2D skeletal animation). For performance optimization, you can pack **Sprites** into **Sprite Atlases** to improve request and rendering performance.
