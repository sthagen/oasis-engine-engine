After the model is imported, new model assets will be added to the **[Assets Panel](/en/docs/assets/interface)**. Clicking on the asset thumbnail will display basic information about the model.

## Sub-assets of the Model

Hover over the model asset thumbnail, click on the triangle button that appears on the right side, and information about the sub-assets contained in the model asset, such as meshes, textures, animations, and materials, will be displayed in the resource panel.

### Mesh Sub-asset

Clicking on the mesh sub-asset thumbnail will display basic information about the mesh as follows:

| Area       | Function         | Description                   |
| :--------- | :--------------- | :----------------------------- |
| Vertex Data| Vertex Info List | Format and stride of vertex information |
| Submesh    | Submesh List     | Drawing information of submeshes |

### Texture Sub-asset

The basic information of a texture sub-asset is the only difference from a [texture](/en/docs/graphics-texture) asset, as most texture information is read-only.

### Material Sub-Asset

Similarly, the [material](/en/docs/graphics-material) sub-asset is as follows:

In general, users do not need to perform any operations on the material that comes with the model; however, in certain scenarios, developers may want to manually adjust the material, such as changing the color. In this case, we can duplicate the original material by clicking **duplicate & remap**, and then make modifications based on the original material parameters:

### Animation Sub-Asset

Animation sub-assets appear in the model asset in the form of [animation clips](/en/docs/animation/clip) and are also **read-only**.
