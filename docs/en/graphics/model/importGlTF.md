> Models are exported from modeling software such as [Blender](https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.80/addons/io_scene_gltf2.html) in FBX or glTF format, or can be downloaded from model websites like [Sketchfab](https://sketchfab.com/).

Once you have your model ready, you can import it into the Galacean editor for editing. You can import models in the following file formats:

- **(.gltf + .bin + images)**
- **(.glb + images)**
- **(.fbx)**

It's important to note that the editor will convert FBX files into a runtime-parseable [glTF format](/en/docs/graphics-model-glTF). Next, let's see how to import model files into the editor.

## Drag and Drop Import

Drag the model file or a compressed **.zip** file into the Assets panel:

After importing, the imported model asset will appear in the **[Assets panel](/en/docs/assets/interface)**. Let's explore what the [model asset contains](/en/docs/graphics-model-assets).
