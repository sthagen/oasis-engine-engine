Galacean supports referencing type animation curves, you can add keyframes of type assets such as (sprites). The following is the process of creating sprite animations:

1. Add the `SpriteRenderer` component to the node

4. Enable recording mode, click on the corresponding frame in the editor, and add a `Sprite` in the `SpriteRenderer` to automatically add keyframes

### Script Implementation

Starting from version 1.1, the engine supports referencing type animation curves ([AnimationRefCurve](/apis/core/#AnimationRefCurve)), where the values of keyframes can be assets such as (sprites, materials). You can create reference type animation curves to achieve capabilities like frame animation:
