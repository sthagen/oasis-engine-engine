The hierarchy panel is located on the far left side of the editor. It displays all the nodes in the current scene in a tree structure. The scene node is the parent node of all other nodes, including cameras, lights, meshes, etc.

In the hierarchy panel, you can:

- Add, delete, or clone a node
- Copy the path information of a node
- Adjust the hierarchy of nodes by dragging
- Fuzzy search for nodes in the scene
- Temporarily hide a node

## Adding, Deleting, and Copying Nodes

### Adding Nodes

> You can add empty nodes or quickly add nodes with corresponding functional components, such as nodes with camera components, light source components, and basic 3D/2D rendering components.

You can click the "+" button in the hierarchy tree panel to add a node. Note that if you have a node selected, the added node will become a **child node of the selected node**; otherwise, it will default to being a child node of the scene:

/>

After adding, you can edit the properties of the new node in the **[Inspector Panel](/en/docs/interface/inspector)**.

### Deleting Nodes

To delete a node, you can use the following methods:

- Select the node to be deleted -> Click the delete button
- Select the node to be deleted -> Press the <Kbd>Delete</Kbd> key
- Right-click a node -> Delete

<Callout type="warning">
  Deleting a node will delete the node and all its child nodes. So when deleting a node, you need to be aware of whether the deleted node will affect other nodes in the scene.
</Callout>

### Copying Nodes

> Copying a node will copy the selected node and all its child nodes, essentially calling the engine's [clone](/en/docs/core/clone) capability.

After selecting a node, you can quickly clone the node at the same level by using `Duplicated`.

You can also choose `copy` and `paste` separately to achieve cross-level copying.

Additionally, you can quickly copy the selected node using the shortcut key <Kbd>⌘ + D</Kbd>.

## Node Sorting

To better organize nodes, you can sort nodes by dragging. After selecting a node, you can change its position in the hierarchy tree by dragging it with the left mouse button.

## Node Search

There is a search box at the top of the hierarchy panel where users can enter the name of a node to search for nodes in the scene. The search box supports fuzzy search, allowing you to enter part of the node's name to find it.

## Node Hiding

Each entity node has an eye button on the right side. Clicking it toggles the node's visibility in the scene.

> Note that adjusting the node's visibility here only affects the workspace and not the `isActive` property in the **[Inspector Panel](/en/docs/interface/inspector)**.

## Shortcuts

The following operations are effective only after selecting a node.

| Operation         | Shortcut                                   |
| :---------------- | :----------------------------------------- |
| `Delete Node`     | <Kbd>Backspace</Kbd> or <Kbd>Delete</Kbd>  |
| `Copy Node`       | <Kbd>⌘ + D</Kbd>                           |
| `Select Previous Node` | <Kbd>↑</Kbd>                          |
| `Select Next Node` | <Kbd>↓</Kbd>                              |
| `Expand Node`     | <Kbd>→</Kbd>                               |
| `Collapse Node`   | <Kbd>←</Kbd>                               |
