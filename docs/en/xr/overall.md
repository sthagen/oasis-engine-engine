`XR` is a generic term used to describe the concept of Extended Reality (`Extended Reality`), which includes Virtual Reality (VR), Augmented Reality (AR), Mixed Reality (MR), and more.

Galacean has designed XR with a clean and flexible approach:

- Cleaner: When XR capabilities are not needed, the package does not contain any XR logic, and its size does not increase at all
- More flexible: Plug-and-play features make development easier
- Future-oriented: Multi-backend design for future adaptability to different platforms and interfaces
